The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute PhD template in a GitHub repo so I can import it into Overleaf because I'm lazy yet still motivated to over-engineer a solution to a non-existent problem.

For the full instuctions on how to use the RPI thesis LaTex template see here: https://dotcio.rpi.edu/services/printing-publishing/thesis-preparation
